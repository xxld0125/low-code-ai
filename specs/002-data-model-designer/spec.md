# Feature Specification: Data Model Designer

**Feature Branch**: `002-data-model-designer`
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "创建基础数据模型设计器，支持用户通过可视化界面创建数据表，包括字段定义（支持文本、数字、日期、布尔值4种基础类型）、字段配置（字段名、是否必填、默认值设置）、简单的一对多关系配置，并能自动生成对应的Supabase数据库表结构和基础CRUD API接口"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Create Basic Data Table (Priority: P1)

As a developer using the low-code platform, I want to create a new data table through a visual interface so that I can define the structure of my application's data without writing database schemas directly.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables users to create data models, which is foundational to any application built on the platform.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a simple table with basic fields and verifying the table structure is generated in the database, delivering immediate value for data modeling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the data model designer page, **When** I click "Create New Table" and define table name and fields, **Then** a new table is created in the system
2. **Given** I have created a table, **When** I view the table list, **Then** my new table appears with the correct field definitions
3. **Given** I am defining a field, **When** I select text type, **Then** the field is created as a text column in the database

---

### User Story 2 - Configure Field Properties (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to configure individual field properties like field names, required status, and default values so that my data model enforces proper data constraints and business rules.

**Why this priority**: Field configuration is essential for data integrity and validation, which are critical for any production application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating fields with different configurations and verifying database constraints are properly applied, delivering data validation capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am adding a new field, **When** I set it as required, **Then** the database enforces NOT NULL constraint for that field
2. **Given** I am configuring a field, **When** I set a default value, **Then** the database applies this default value for new records
3. **Given** I am editing field properties, **When** I change the field name, **Then** the database column is updated accordingly

---

### User Story 3 - Define One-to-Many Relationships (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to establish simple one-to-many relationships between tables so that I can model connected data structures like user posts and comments, or products and orders.

**Why this priority**: Relationships are fundamental to relational databases and enable building complex, interconnected applications while maintaining data consistency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating two tables with a one-to-many relationship and verifying foreign key constraints work correctly, delivering relational data modeling capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have created two tables, **When** I define a one-to-many relationship from table A to table B, **Then** a foreign key is properly established in the database
2. **Given** I have established a relationship, **When** I attempt to delete a parent record with existing child records, **Then** the system handles referential integrity appropriately
3. **Given** I am viewing related tables, **When** I examine the relationship, **Then** the foreign key references are correctly displayed

---

### User Story 4 - Auto-generate CRUD API Endpoints (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for my data tables so that I can immediately start building frontend functionality without writing backend code.

**Why this priority**: Auto-generated APIs dramatically accelerate development time by providing immediate data access capabilities for frontend integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a table and then making API calls to verify all CRUD operations work as expected, delivering complete data access functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have created a data table, **When** I check the available API endpoints, **Then** CRUD endpoints are automatically available for that table
2. **Given** I have API endpoints available, **When** I make a POST request to create a record, **Then** the record is created successfully and returned
3. **Given** I am using the API, **When** I make a GET request for records, **Then** I receive the data in the expected format
4. **Given** I need to update data, **When** I make a PUT/PATCH request to the update endpoint, **Then** the record is updated successfully

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to delete a table that has dependent relationships with existing data?
- How does the system handle exceeding database field size limits or data type constraints?
- What happens when two users attempt to modify the same table schema simultaneously?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies in table relationships?
- What occurs when database migration fails due to syntax errors or conflicts?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a visual interface for creating and managing data tables
- **FR-002**: System MUST support four basic field types: text, number, date, and boolean
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to configure field properties including field name, required status, and default values
- **FR-004**: System MUST support creation of one-to-many relationships between tables with proper foreign key constraints
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically generate Supabase database table structures based on user configurations
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically generate basic CRUD API endpoints for all created tables
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate field configurations to prevent invalid database schemas
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle database migrations safely to preserve existing data
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide feedback to users about the status of table creation and API generation
- **FR-010**: System MUST support editing of existing table structures and field configurations
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain data integrity when modifying table relationships
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear error messages when table creation or modification fails

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Data Table**: Represents a database table with metadata including table name, description, and creation timestamp
- **Field Definition**: Represents a column in a data table with properties for name, data type, constraints (required, unique), and default values
- **Table Relationship**: Represents a one-to-many relationship between two tables with foreign key configuration and cascading rules
- **API Endpoint**: Represents auto-generated CRUD operations for each table with standard REST patterns
- **Schema Migration**: Records changes made to table structures for version control and rollback capabilities
