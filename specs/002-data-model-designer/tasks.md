## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Story Dependencies

1. **User Story 1** (Create Basic Data Table) - No dependencies
2. **User Story 2** (Configure Field Properties) - Depends on US1
3. **User Story 3** (Define Relationships) - Depends on US1, US2
4. **User Story 4** (Auto-generate APIs) - Depends on US1, US2

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within User Story 1 (Phase 3)**:

- Component development (T020, T021, T025, T027) can be done in parallel
- API and validation logic (T022, T023, T024) can be developed concurrently
- Tests (T031-T034) can be written alongside implementation

**Within User Story 2 (Phase 4)**:

- UI components (T035, T036, T039) and backend logic (T037, T038, T042) can be parallelized
- Field configuration and migration logic can be developed simultaneously

**Within User Story 3 (Phase 5)**:

- Visual components (T047, T048, T054) and relationship logic (T051, T053) can be parallel
- Drag-and-drop integration can be developed independently

**Within User Story 4 (Phase 6)**:

- API generation logic (T060) and route handlers (T061) can be developed in parallel
- Testing utilities (T067) can be created alongside implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Approach

1. **Phase 1-2**: Foundation infrastructure (critical for all features)
2. **Phase 3**: Core table creation functionality (delivers immediate value)
3. **Phase 4**: Field configuration (enhances data modeling capabilities)
4. **Phase 5-6**: Advanced features (relationships and API generation)
5. **Phase 7**: Polish and collaboration improvements

### Incremental Delivery

- **MVP**: Complete Phase 1-4 for basic table and field management
- **Version 2**: Add Phase 5 for relationship support
- **Version 3**: Add Phase 6 for automatic API generation
- **Version 4**: Add Phase 7 for collaboration and polish

### Risk Mitigation

- Start with core table creation to validate database integration early
- Implement comprehensive testing for database operations
- Use feature flags for controlled rollout of complex features
- Focus on performance optimization for large schema handling

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Component rendering and interaction tests
- Validation logic tests
- API function tests
- State management tests

### Integration Tests

- Complete workflow tests for each user story
- Database constraint verification
- API endpoint integration tests
- Drag-and-drop functionality tests

### Performance Tests

- Bundle size verification (<150KB gzipped)
- API response time tests (<500ms)
- Large schema handling tests (up to 20 tables)
- Database operation performance tests

**Next Steps**: Begin with Phase 1 (Setup & Foundation) to establish the project structure, then proceed through each user story phase sequentially for systematic implementation.
