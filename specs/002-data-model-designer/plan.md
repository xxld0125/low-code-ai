# Implementation Plan: Data Model Designer

**Branch**: `002-data-model-designer` | **Date**: 2025-01-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-data-model-designer/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature will create a visual data model designer that allows users to create and manage database tables through an intuitive interface. The system will support four basic field types (text, number, date, boolean), field configuration (name, required status, default values), one-to-many relationships, and will automatically generate Supabase database structures with CRUD API endpoints. The implementation will use React/TypeScript for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and will integrate with the existing low-code platform architecture.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ (Next.js 15)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15, React 19, Supabase, shadcn/ui, Zustand
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL (managed database)
**Testing**: Jest + Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web browser (responsive design)
**Project Type**: Web application (feature-based structure)
**Performance Goals**: <500ms API response, <2s UI load, <150KB bundle size
**Constraints**: Supabase service limitations, browser compatibility, basic collaboration support, drag-and-drop UI complexity
**Scale/Scope**: Support up to 20 tables per project, basic multi-user support, drag-and-drop interface

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Code Quality Excellence Gates

- [x] TypeScript strict mode compliance confirmed (existing project uses strict mode)
- [x] ESLint configuration covers all code patterns (existing comprehensive config)
- [x] Prettier formatting enforced in pre-commit hooks (existing setup)
- [x] Code organization follows feature-based structure (planned structure aligns)

### Test-First Development Gates

- [x] Test framework (Jest/Testing Library) configured (existing excellent setup)
- [x] Minimum 80% coverage requirements established (existing coverage config)
- [x] Integration test strategy defined for user workflows (existing patterns)
- [x] Unit tests for core user workflows (existing Jest setup)

### User Experience Consistency Gates

- [x] shadcn/ui design system integration confirmed (existing design system)
- [x] Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) compliance strategy defined (constitution requirement)
- [x] Responsive design breakpoints established (existing Tailwind setup)
- [x] User interaction performance thresholds set (<100ms for validation, <2s load)

### Performance-First Architecture Gates

- [x] Core Web Vitals targets defined (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- [x] Bundle size budgets established (<150KB gzipped for designer)
- [x] Database performance requirements specified (<500ms API response)
- [x] Performance regression testing approach defined (existing performance tests)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected, aligning with existing Next.js 15 + Supabase architecture. Designer components organized in feature-based structure within `/components/designer/`, API logic in `/lib/designer/`, and tests in `/tests/projects/designer/`.

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
