# Implementation Plan: Project Management for Low-Code Platform

**Branch**: `001-project-management` | **Date**: 2025-01-21 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-project-management/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-project-management/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements a comprehensive project management system for the low-code platform, enabling authenticated users to create, manage, and collaborate on low-code development projects. The implementation will leverage the existing Supabase authentication system and build upon the established Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript architecture with shadcn/ui components.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ (Next.js 15 configuration)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15, React 19, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth), shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL (hosted database with real-time capabilities)
**Testing**: API testing + Database testing (Supabase test database integration)
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design for desktop and mobile)
**Project Type**: Web application (single Next.js project with App Router)
**Performance Goals**: < 100ms API response time for project operations, < 2.5s overall page load
**Constraints**: Efficient database queries, < 100ms database query response time
**Scale/Scope**: Support for thousands of users with up to 100 projects each, API-focused testing coverage
