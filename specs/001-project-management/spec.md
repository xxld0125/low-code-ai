# Feature Specification: Project Management for Low-Code Platform

**Feature Branch**: `[001-project-management]`
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "创建低代码平台的项目管理功能，基于现有Supabase认证系统，支持用户创建和管理低代码项目、项目列表展示、项目删除和重命名、项目权限管理（项目所有者可以邀请协作者），每个认证用户可以创建和管理自己的低代码项目"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Project Creation and Listing (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to create new low-code projects and see all my projects in a list so that I can organize and manage my development work.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other project management features. Without the ability to create and view projects, no other workflows are possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a user logging in, creating a project, and verifying it appears in their project list. This delivers core value by providing basic project organization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged into the platform, **When** I click "Create New Project" and fill in project details, **Then** a new project is created and appears in my project list
2. **Given** I have multiple projects, **When** I view my project dashboard, **Then** I see all my projects displayed with names and creation dates
3. **Given** I am not authenticated, **When** I try to access project management, **Then** I am redirected to the login page

### User Story 2 - Project Operations (Delete and Rename) (Priority: P2)

As a project owner, I want to rename and delete my projects so that I can maintain accurate project organization and remove outdated work.

**Why this priority**: Essential for project lifecycle management. Users need to maintain clean workspaces and update project names as requirements evolve.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a project, renaming it, and verifying the new name appears, then deleting it and confirming it's removed from the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am the project owner, **When** I choose to rename a project, **Then** the project name is updated and reflects across the platform
2. **Given** I am the project owner, **When** I delete a project, **Then** the project is permanently removed and no longer appears in any lists
3. **Given** I attempt to rename someone else's project, **When** I try to save the changes, **Then** I receive an "access denied" message

---

### User Story 3 - Project Collaboration and Permissions (Priority: P3)

As a project owner, I want to invite other users to collaborate on my projects so that teams can work together on low-code development projects.

**Why this priority**: Enables team collaboration which is critical for real-world usage. While individual users can create projects, team features expand the platform's value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a project owner inviting another user, that user accepting the invitation, and both users being able to access the shared project.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a project owner, **When** I invite another user by email, **Then** that user receives an invitation and can accept to join the project
2. **Given** I am invited to a project, **When** I accept the invitation, **Then** the project appears in my project list with appropriate access level
3. **Given** I am a project owner, **When** I remove a collaborator's access, **Then** that user can no longer access the project
4. **Given** I am a collaborator on a project, **When** I attempt to delete the project, **Then** I receive an "insufficient permissions" message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a project owner's account is deleted? All owner's projects are deleted and all project data is permanently removed.
- How does system handle duplicate project names within a user's workspace?
- What happens when trying to invite a user who doesn't have an account?
- How are project invitations handled when the invited user is already at their project limit?
- What happens to project data when a project is deleted? All project data is permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via existing Supabase authentication system before allowing any project operations
- **FR-002**: Authenticated users MUST be able to create new projects with custom names and descriptions
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to view a list of all projects they have access to (owned or collaborated)
- **FR-004**: Project owners MUST be able to rename their projects
- **FR-005**: Project owners MUST be able to delete their projects
- **FR-006**: Project owners MUST be able to invite other registered users as collaborators
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent non-owners from performing owner-only operations (delete, rename, manage collaborators)
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain project ownership and collaboration permissions
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that project names are unique within a user's workspace
- **FR-010**: System MUST permanently delete projects and all associated data immediately upon deletion
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to accept or decline project invitations
- **FR-012**: Project owners MUST be able to remove collaborators from their projects

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Project**: Represents a low-code development project with name, description, creation date, and owner information
- **User**: Represents authenticated platform users with basic profile information from Supabase Auth
- **Project Collaboration**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between users and projects, defining access levels and permissions
- **Project Invitation**: Represents pending invitations for users to join projects

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a new project and see it in their list within 3 seconds
- **SC-002**: Project operations (rename, delete) complete successfully in under 2 seconds
- **SC-003**: 95% of project invitations are successfully delivered and processed within the same session
- **SC-004**: Users can navigate to any of their projects from the project list in under 1 second
- **SC-005**: 100% of permission checks prevent unauthorized project access
- **SC-006**: Project data integrity is maintained during all CRUD operations

### Performance Success Criteria (Constitution Alignment)

- **PSC-001**: Project dashboard loads with LCP under 2.5s for users with up to 100 projects
- **PSC-002**: JavaScript bundles for project management features under 150KB gzipped
- **PSC-003**: Project database queries (list, create, update, delete) under 100ms average response time
- **PSC-004**: Project operation UI responses (create, rename, delete) under 100ms perceived latency
- **PSC-005**: Project management interface meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility
