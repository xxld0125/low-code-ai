# Tasks: Project Management for Low-Code Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-project-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: API testing and database testing included as specified in research.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project management directory structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Install required dependencies for project management feature
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure TypeScript strict mode and ESLint rules for project files
- [ ] T004 [P] Setup API testing framework with Supabase test database
- [ ] T005 [P] Setup database testing utilities and test data factories
- [ ] T006 [P] Configure performance monitoring for API endpoints (< 100ms response time)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T011 Configure Supabase client extensions for project management
- [ ] T012 Create base project utilities in lib/projects/
- [ ] T013 [P] Setup API routing structure for /api/projects/
- [ ] T014 [P] Configure error handling for project management APIs
- [ ] T015 [P] Setup performance monitoring for database queries (< 100ms query time)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Project Creation and Listing (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- API and Database tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Type definitions before database operations
- Database operations before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Type definitions within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (ensure they FAIL first):
Task: "API test for POST /api/projects in tests/projects/api/create-project.test.ts"
Task: "API test for GET /api/projects in tests/projects/api/get-projects.test.ts"
Task: "Database test for projects table constraints in tests/projects/database/projects.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for project creation workflow in tests/projects/integration/project-workflow.test.ts"

# Launch all type definitions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Project type definitions in types/projects/project.ts"
Task: "Create project database queries in lib/projects/queries.ts"
Task: "Create project database mutations in lib/projects/mutations.ts"

# Launch all UI components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create ProjectList component in components/projects/ProjectList.tsx"
Task: "Create ProjectCard component in components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx"
Task: "Create CreateProjectModal component in components/projects/CreateProjectModal.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Performance & Quality Requirements

### API Performance Targets

- **Project Operations**: < 100ms response time
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms average query time
- **Project List Loading**: < 200ms for up to 100 projects

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with comprehensive type coverage
- **Testing**: API and database integration tests required
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Bundle Size**: < 150KB gzipped for project management features

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication**: Supabase JWT-based auth for all operations
- **Authorization**: Row-level security with role-based permissions
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Audit Trail**: All project actions logged in activity_log

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify API and database tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance requirements must be met for all API endpoints
- Security policies (RLS) must be enforced for all database operations
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
